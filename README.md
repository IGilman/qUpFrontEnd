Welcome! 

This is a personal project I started in June 2021 to learn more and spend time on things I want to work on outside of work. 

A few things I've learned so far before committing this repo to GitHub: 

    +MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node). My Node code is going to be in a different repo
    +Basic Authentication/API Protection/Route Guards/JWTs --> all via Auth0

Backend repo here: https://github.com/IGilman/qUpBackEnd

More things I anticipate learning

    +Logging in via Discord/Facebook (using Auth0) 
    +Using NG Material Design
    +Learning SCSS/SASS
    +Better code structuring for a larger Angular app
    +More about the MEAN Stack
    +Implementing an in-app chat service????   

I've been trying to see how much I can get done in ~100 hours (1 hour a day) of code. Every day I code, I tweet out what I learn. Twitter is here: https://twitter.com/IsaacGilman

Let me know if you have question and thanks for taking a look! 

Best,
Isaac
